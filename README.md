# AI-Robotics-ComputerVision

# Overview
This is a project that uses convoluted neural network to recognize hand gestures.
Note that the Python version used in this program is Python 3.0

# Setup
## Install tensorflow

## Install scikit-learn

## Install StereoVision and setup for stereocamera
Install StereoVision library by 
```
pip install StereoVision
```
Then install progressbar for Python3
```
pip install progressbar33
```
Run capture_chessboards from the command line
Change the source code in calibrate_cameras by adding parethesis around print statement at line 50.
Then run calibrate_cameras from the command line

Change the source code in python library stereovision folder for blockmatchers.py
Note: cv2.STEREO_BM_BASIC_PRESET = 0, cv2.STEREO_BM_FISH_EYE_PRESET = 1, cv2.STEREO_BM_NARROW_PRESET = 2
