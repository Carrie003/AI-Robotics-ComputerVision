# AI-Robotics-FinalProject

# Overview
This is a project that uses convoluted neural network to recognize hand gestures.
Note that the Python version used in this program is Python 3.6

# Setup
## Install tensorflow

## Install scikit-learn

## Run realtime_cnn.py to detect gestures.

## Run gather_data.py to take pictures into dataset.

## Run cnn_train.py to train our model.

## Run realtime_preprocess.py to test if computer can tell hand from background.
